# Homework - CFD

We are going to solve the diffusion (heat) equation on the next CFD lab.

There is a couple of YouTube videos (from 3Blue1Brown channel) with an excellent visualisation of the underlaying physics.

If you feel that you need to refresh some math concepts, have a look at the following:
